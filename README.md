#### Overview
This holy grail is a basic web page layout which has multiple equal-height columns that are defined with style sheets. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which it could be implemented with available technologies all had drawbacks.Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail.

In this example, I use CSS Grid to create a basic Holy Grail layout, which consists of a header, footer, and main content area with two sidebars on the sides. The layout is achieved by using a grid container and defining the grid template rows and columns.
